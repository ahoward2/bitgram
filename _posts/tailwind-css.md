Building a developer blog/portfolio with NextJS and Tailwind CSS ⭐️

I've been super excited over the past couple of weeks to get started redesigning my developer portfolio/blog
from scratch with 2 new frameworks that have recently been growing in popularity: **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**!

## ⚔️ NEXT.JS
---

If you haven't heard of Next.js yet, it's AWESOME. The Next.js team calls it "The React Framework for Production". The big up-side to Next.js is you can do a mixture of static site generation server-side rendering without really any configuration at all. 🤯

I've really just begun to scratch the surface, but once I get a good feel for it through building this website, I will update here in this blog post!

## 💨 Tailwind CSS
---

Tailwind CSS is a very interesting CSS framework. Basically you can just do ultra custom inline styling with a huge library of utility classes. I wanted to use Tailwind for this personal blog for the purely custom feel that will set the look and feel of the website apart from anything else on the internet. 💎

## 📸 Content Management
---

I personally love writing all of my notes and blog posts in markdown! Instead of using a normal CMS, I'm instead going to just be writing all of my blog posts in markdown and they will automatically generate a new post on the blog whenever I add a new one the my '_posts' folder in my project. 📦
