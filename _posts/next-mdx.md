## üî© Software

‚öôÔ∏è Gatsby is a secondary option to Next.js for static site generation. Next provides support for both SSG and SSR while Gatsby only supports SSG.

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- Storybook.js
- Next.js SSG
- Webpack
- MDX (Markdown +JSX)

‚öôÔ∏è **Example:** [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/docs/overview) uses Next.js for their framework website and documentation. They also have a code sandbox for learning and tutorials.
